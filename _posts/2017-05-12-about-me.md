## About Me
Life is so interesting with it's attractive emotions, with new impressive adventures in perspective, with surprises and vital puzzles. I am a seeker of them. Once I decided that all of this I could get with Computer Science and start studying with great hopes. Now I am happy with my decision, on the way of getting accustomed with the world of Computer Sciense I have learnt many interesting thing from different fields. For example I when I introduced Artificial Intelligence and Artificial Neural Networks I was working on Georgian Versification, was making AI system which would learn characteristics of the Georgian poems: it's structure, poetical methods, writing style of some Georgian poets and etc.

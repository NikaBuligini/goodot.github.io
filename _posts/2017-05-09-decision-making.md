## Decision making using Fuzzy Logic

Beautiful girl. Sweet chocolate, Good basketball player.

How can we express this mathematicaly? What does mean this words beautiful, sweet or good? Beautiful compared to what? Is there some average value of beauty? I think it is just depended on taste. But why we can not express our taste mathematicaly? If we believe to [Lotfi Zadeh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotfi_A._Zadeh) we can do that for fair. This guy introduced us [Fuzzy Set Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzy_set) in 1965. I suppose he wanted to use mathematics even in such obscure situations when you can not say how good player [Manu Ginobili](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manu_Gin%C3%B3bili) is, how sweet is this chocolate you are eating now with strong coffee, how beautiful was the girl you met accidentaly yeasterday in underground. 

Imagine that you are [coach Pop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregg_Popovich) and you need to select good center for [San Antonio Spurs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio_Spurs).

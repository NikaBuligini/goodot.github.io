## Decision making using Fuzzy Logic

Beautiful girl. Sweet chocolate. Good basketball player.

How can we express this mathematicaly? What do mean this words beautiful, sweet or good? Beautiful compared to what? Is there some average value of beauty? I think it is just depended on taste. But why we can not express our taste mathematicaly? If we believe to [Lotfi Zadeh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotfi_A._Zadeh) we can do that for fair. This guy introduced us [Fuzzy Set Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzy_set) in 1965. This theory means set whose elements have some degrees of membership. In classic theory of sets the element should be member of set or not, but in Zadeh's theory the element is a member of given set partially with some degree.  I suppose he wanted to use mathematics even in such obscure situations when you can not say how good player [Manu Ginobili](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manu_Gin%C3%B3bili) is, how sweet is this chocolate you are eating now with strong coffee, how beautiful was the girl you met accidentaly yeasterday in underground. Your brain is reminding all chocolates you have eaten, their tastes and the pleasures you have got with them. He (brain is a guy) is calculating all average pleasure degrees and comparing it to new one. Brain is not so simple but I like such simulation of this outguessed process. Outguessed because we can not get out from ourselves and observe to our mind. But average of degrees of emotions really good idea. I like it.

Imagine that you are [coach Pop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregg_Popovich) and you need to select good center for [San Antonio Spurs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio_Spurs).
